# E-Book Dynamic Programming

Tutorial was created in C# using VisualStudio 2019 in Ukrainian

The purpose of the work: to create an electronic guide to consider the main problems and methods of dynamic programming solutions by profile. Paving of an arbitrary plane is often used in practice, one of the vivid examples is the laying of parquet, it is necessary to calculate the number of options for paving the plane, the use of dynamic programming by profile has become an integral part of life for many companies, because thanks to this, the complexity of the algorithm of many programs has been significantly reduced, as well as tasks this type is often used in interviews before hiring a new employee. Therefore, this work is relevant. The goal was to create an electronic guide to the consideration of dynamic programming by profile, we will consider the following tasks:
1. Consider dynamic programming by profile.
2. Calculation of the complexity of the profile dynamics algorithm
3. Create an electronic directory.

TASK:
Find the number of ways to tile an n × m table using 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 dominoes. Provided that n and m < 10. And:
1. The plane must be completely filled.
2. Domenoshki should not overlap
3. Dominoshki should not climb beyond the edges of the plane
